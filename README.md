### Brief description
- We estimate the total factor productivity (TFP) at firm level, a proxy for firm productivity. We based on an assumption that the output of firm i is identified through a Cobb-Douglas production function.
- We then examine how cross-listing impacts firms' productivity in Energy-electricity sector over the last two decades with crisis.
- Our findings provide valuable guidance for policymakers and firm managers seeking to enhance the productivity of energy firms following cross-listing.
