# Firm productivity in the Energy-electricity sector over the last two decades with crisis: The role of cross-listing
## <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eneco.2024.107309">Published in Energy Economics</a>

### Brief description
- We estimate the total factor productivity (TFP) at firm level, a proxy for firm productivity. We based on an assumption that the output of firm i is identified through a Cobb-Douglas production function.
- We then examine how cross-listing impacts firms' productivity in Energy-electricity sector over the last two decades with crisis.
- Our findings provide valuable guidance for policymakers and firm managers seeking to enhance the productivity of energy firms following cross-listing. 
- Published in Energy Economics (an **A star-ranked & top field** journal)

### Technical skills used in this project
- Retrieved the firm-level data from **Refinitiv Workspace** using **Eikon Data API for Python** (**please see the file "Refinitiv.ipynb" above**)
- Transformed and processed data using **Power Query and Stata** to ensure data completeness and validity
- Estimated firm productivity and performed different empirical panel data analyses using **Stata**
